# Number-matching-game

The Number Matching Game is a C program where players match pairs of numbers hidden in a 4x4 grid.
Numbers are randomized, and players guess their positions using coordinates.
Correct matches stay revealed, while incorrect ones are hidden again. 
The game tracks found pairs and the number of attempts, ending successfully when all pairs are matched or allowing the player to quit anytime.
It uses functions for grid initialization, display, and gameplay logic.
